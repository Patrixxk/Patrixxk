Hey,<br>I'm currently the Head of Development at Gaelta s.r.o. agency. My journey in tech began in early 2022 when I started dabbling in Frontend Development from my room. My first steps were learning HTML and CSS, and soon after, I moved on to Vanilla JS and React.<br><br>üîß My early career was focused on custom coding, but as my projects evolved, I shifted toward working on eCommerce websites and CMS systems. This led me to dive into platforms like WordPress, Shopify, Shoptet, Upgates, and PrestaShop (with the occasional smaller CMS project).<br>üîÑ After about a year in the CMS world, I decided to take a TypeScript course. Looking back, I probably jumped into it a bit too soon‚Äîafter being away from pure coding for a while, the knowledge only stuck for a month or so üòÖ.<br>üíª CMS has played a major role in getting me to where I am today. Along the way, I also learned about site migration, server-side coding, and of course, a ton of PHP (mostly in CMS systems). However, I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a PHP expert‚ÄîI can read it, but I'm not deep in the trenches with it.<br><br>üöÄ Currently, I‚Äôm learning Vue.js to prepare for my next project. Since I‚Äôve worked a lot with React before, Vue is a bit easier to pick up and I'm excited for the challenge ahead!
